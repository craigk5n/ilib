Ilib Perl module!

This is alpha-level code, and not all Ilib functions are supported (due to
my incomplete understanding of how to create perl modules).  For instance,
IReadImage() is not yet supported (just ICreateImage()).

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Send bug reports, patches, etc. to me at cknudsen@radix.net.
