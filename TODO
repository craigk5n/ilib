Ilib TODO List
Last Updated: 15 Aug 2001
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Complete the Perl module (it does not yet implement the full API)
- PHP3/4 Module
- Add a font path and search the font path for any requested font file
- Add support for True Type fonts (scalable w/ anti-aliasing)
- Add support for PostScript output -- would allow printing of images
- Add man pages for client apps (iconvert, ifont2h, etc.) as well
  as man pages for the Ilib functions.
- New Functions:
  + ICalculateTextCoordinates
    pass in text, font, desired text alignment (below point, to left of
    pointer, etc.) and get back a coordinate to draw text
  + IReduceColors
    reduce colors to 256 (8-bit) or less for writing GIFs and other 8-bit
    image formats
    would also be nice to add support for converting to a specified
    colormap
