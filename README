Ilib-1.1.9
Copyright (C) 2001-2004 Craig Knudsen, cknudsen@cknudsen.com

Ilib is a library (and some tools and examples) written in C
that can read, create, manipulate and save images.  It is capable
of using X11 BDF fonts for drawing text.  That means you get
lots (208, to be exact) of fonts to use.  You can even create your
own if you know how to create an X11 BDF font.  It can read and
write PPM, XPM, GIF, PNG and JPG image format.  It can read (but not
yet write) BMP.

PERL MODULE!
The Ilib perl module is now included with the distribution.  It is not
compiled or installed by default.  This perl module builds like all other
perl modules.  AFTER installing the rest of Ilib (see instructions below),
do the following:
  cd perl
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install
(Normally, you will need to be root to install.)


EXTRAS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download and install EITHER Giflib or Libungif if you want to read or
write GIFs.  Giflib is available at:
	http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/giflib.shtml
Libungif is available at:
	http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/libungif.shtml

Download and install libpng if you want to read or write PNGs:
	http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/pngcode.html

Download and install libjpeg to read and write JPEGs:
	ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/

Download additional X11 BDF fonts:
	ftp://ftp.xfree.org/pub/XFree86/current/untarred/xc/fonts/bdf/75dpi/
	  or try
	ftp://ftp.xfree.org/pub/XFree86/3.3.3.1/untarred/xc/fonts/bdf/75dpi/

Edit/Import/Create BDF fonts with xmbdfed (requires Motif/Lesstif):
	(not sure where the primary location for this... use
	AltaVista to find it.)


COMPILING (UNIX):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to make use of GIF, PNG or JPEG, you need to obtain the
add-on libraries mentioned above.  (First, check your system.  If
you have a Linux distribution, it's likely to have some of these
installed.)

Edit the definitions of LIBS, DEFINES, INCLUDES to indicate which
libraries are installed.  Change PREFIX if you don't want to install
in /usr/local.

Also, edit the values of CC and RANLIB if needed.

Then, just type "make makefiles; make all" to build everthing.
Both a shared and static library will be buily in the "lib" directory.
Type "make install" to install everything (defaults to /usr/local).

Look at the programs in "examples" and "clients" as examples how to use
Ilib.  The example program "iconvert" shows a handy tool for converting
images between different formats and "isample" shows how to draw text,
lines, etc.

COMPILING (Win32):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should be able to use the Cygnus Win32 package to build Ilib using the
provided makefiles.  I have not tested this since Ilib v1.0.

Ilib-1.1.0 has also been built on Win95 with MS Visual Developer (Visual
C++).  GIFLIB was also built with MS Visual Developer.  Sorry, I'm not
going to try and provide makefiles or project files for this.
